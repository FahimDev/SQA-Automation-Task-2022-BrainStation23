As this web application is new to me, In the 1st stage I did Exploratory Test. And Prepared my Test Scenario and Test Case document in a XL file.

With that XL Document I was performing Formal Manual Testing to make sure that the Software is Stable or not.
As I found the Software Stable Then I started writing my Automation Test Script. 

Though During Manual Test I am conducting my'TS_MyStore_003' in seven different Test Cases. But in Automation Test the whole test will run under one Test Case, As I have to be respectful at the "Automation Task- 2022" Requirement which is => Run the above cycle for another user.

To keep our Automation Test System Dynamic I am keeping all user inputs in a XL file's Sprite Sheet.
